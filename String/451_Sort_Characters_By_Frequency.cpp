	451. Sort Characters By Frequency
	
	Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

	Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

	 

	Example 1:

	Input: s = "tree"
	Output: "eert"
	Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
	So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
