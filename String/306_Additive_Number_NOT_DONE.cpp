	An additive number is a string whose digits can form an additive sequence.

	A valid additive sequence should contain at least three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

	Given a string containing only digits, return true if it is an additive number or false otherwise.

	Note: Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros, so sequence 1, 2, 03 or 1, 02, 3 is invalid.

	 

	Example 1:

	Input: "112358"
	Output: true
	Explanation: 
	The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 
	1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8
